Hi there!

I'm a graduate student studying synthetic biology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. 

My research focuses on directed evolution and machine learning techniques for sustainable biofactories. This work builds on my Bachelor's in Computational Molecular Biology from Brown University. I also have years of experience in technical consulting and account management in B2B SaaS, as well as in cancer research and in fisheries research. 

Outside of work, I love to play violin and guitar, and I sing in choirs and dance salsa.
